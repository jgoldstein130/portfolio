							<h2 class = 'section_header'>Autonomous Car Senior Design Project</h2>
						</header>
						<p class = 'description'>For my senior design project for my computer engineering degree, I worked with a team of
							computer and electrical engineering students to modify a toy car to autonomously follow a person holding a ultra-wideband module.  
							I worked on the navigation system and the motor control for the car.  The code was written in Arduino
							code.
							<br />
							The car works by using ultra-wideband technology.  There are two esp32 boards connected to ultra-wideband modules
							on the front right and front left of the car.  There is also an external ultra-wideband module, which is what the car
							follows.  The ultra-wideband modules on the car can sense how far they are away from the external module.  They send this 
							information to the esp32 boards.  The modules on the car are referred to as anchors and the external module is refered to as 
							a tag. The anchors on the car are connected to an Arduino Mega, which calculates if the car should drive 
							forward and which way the car should turn based on how far away the anchors are from the tag.  The Arduino Mega then uses this 
							information to control the motor controllers, which control speed and turning.
